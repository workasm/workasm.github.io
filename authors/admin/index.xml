      <description>I am a C++ Software Engineer at Precitec Optronik GmbH, Germany. My prime interests are C++ algorithms engineering, optimization and parallelization techniques. During my professional career I was involved in software projects from different areas including computational geometry, computer graphics, embedded navigation and routing, network traffic optimization and video streaming, image processing.
Currently I work in EyeTracker project: real-time tracking a human eye position in 6 dimensions (3D position + 3D rotation) used for laser refractive eye surgery.</description>

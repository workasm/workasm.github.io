From a high-level perspective, the overall method splits into two main subroutines, namely an algorithm denoted Bisolve to isolate the real solutions of a zero-dimensional bivariate system, and an algorithm denoted GeoTop to compute the topology of a single algebraic curve. Compared to existing approaches based on elimination techniques, we considerably improve the corresponding lifting steps in both subroutines. As a result, generic position of the input system is never assumed, and thus our algorithm never demands for any change of coordinates. In addition, we significantly limit the types of symbolic operations involved, that is, we only use resultant and  computations as purely symbolic operations. The latter results are achieved by combining techniques from different fields such as (modular) symbolic computation, numerical analysis and algebraic geometry. We have implemented our algorithms as prototypical contributions to the C++-project CGAL. We exploit graphics hardware to expedite the remaining symbolic computations.

The significance of such computations, especially in real algebraic geometry, is hard to undermine. On massively-parallel architectures such as GPU, the degree of datalevel parallelism exposed by an algorithm is the main performance factor. We attain high efficiency through the use of structured matrix theory to assist the realization of relevant operations on polynomials on the graphics hardware. A detailed complexity analysis, assuming the PRAM model, also confirms that our approach achieves a substantially better parallel complexity in comparison to classical algorithms used for symbolic computations. Aside from the theoretical considerations, a large portion of this work is dedicated to the actual algorithm development and optimization techniques where we pay close attention to the specifics of the graphics hardware. As a byproduct of this work, we have developed high-throughput modular arithmetic which we expect to be useful for other GPU applications, in particular, open-key cryptography. We further discuss the algorithms for the solution of a system of polynomial equations, topology computation of algebraic curves and curve visualization which can profit to the full extent from the GPU acceleration.

However, unlike similar algorithms, Bisolve requires no genericity assumption on the input, and there is no need for any kind of coordinate transformation. Furthermore, extensive benchmarks as presented in [2] confirm that the algorithm is highly practical, that is, a corresponding C++ implementation in Cgal outperforms state of the art approaches by a large factor. In this paper, we focus on the theoretical complexity of Bisolve. For two polynomials f,g ∈ Z[x,y] of total degree at most n with integer coefficients bounded by 2^τ, we show that Bisolve computes isolating boxes for all real solutions of the system f = g = 0 using O(n^8 + n^7τ) bit operations, thereby improving the previous record bound for the same task by several magnitudes.","tags":null,"title":"On the complexity of solving a bivariate polynomial system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric Berberich","Pavel Emeliyanenko","Alexander Kobel","Michael Sagraloff"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1307404800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1307404800,"objectID":"1b6c9954965a50e917c7889e6cb8892b","permalink":"https://workasm.github.io/publication/2011-snc/","publishdate":"2011-06-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-snc/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a new certified and complete algorithm to compute arrangements of real planar algebraic curves.
